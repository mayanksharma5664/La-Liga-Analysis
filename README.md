# La Liga Analysis
As a big Barcelona fan and a data science enthusiast I'll create a prediction model for predicting La-Liga standings. This will help fans like me to quantify the probability of who is going to win la-liga based on certain attributes from the dataset. 

I have also conducted a detailed analysis on Barcelona's performance this season (2024-2025). Descriptive measures were used to measure the key players in our squad.
